# README.md Generator

This is a challenge project for the UC Berkeley Extension Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp Course.  The challenge required the use of `node.js` and the "inquirer" package from npm to create a README.md generator.  The challenge required an output that includes these sections: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.  It required the ability to enter a GitHub username and email address.<br><br>I have made answering the questions optional, so the generator will only create sections for which there is content.  For example, I am using the generator to create this README.md and I will not have content for contributing; therefore, there will not be a Contributing section.
